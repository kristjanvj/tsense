tsconfig
========

Utility to program the EEPROM on a tsensor device (Arduino Duemilanove with an ATmega328).

The shell script first calls a python script which constructs a cpp program file which 
can be compiled for the Arduino board. The generated file is then compiled with avr-gcc 
and transformed into the correct hex format. The compliation steps were originally
copied off a shift-[verify] output in the Arduino environment but slightly modified.
The hex code is then uploaded to the Arduino board using avr dude.

A log file of actions is kept by the python program generator. The file includes all
information written to the device EEPROM, including the PRIVATE KEY! This may look
like a security violation, but we can view this record keeping as the manufacturers
very vell protected log of programmed devices. The public and private IDs from this
file must be installed on the authentication service for the programmed devices to 
be allowed into the system.
